Account Recovery

Symptom:    
Someone is asking for an account reactivation / deactivation

Problem:    
- Is the person asking for assistance the legitimate owner of the account?

- How can I escalate the case to the platform? What information do I have to provide?

Solution:   
In all account recovery or deactivation cases you must ensure that the person contacting the Helpline is the the owner of the account, or (particularly in cases where the owner has been incarcerated) the legal representative of the owner of the account. This is crucial to verify before proceeding, no matter how urgent the contact claims the case to be. Owner's of accounts can usually be verified via vetting. Legal representatives can be more difficult, but a combination of vetting and legal documents may be used for verification. Please note that for all account recovery or deactivation cases you should immediately submit a request via the normal public mechanism that the relevant platform provides! This should always be the first step.

1. Some questions you can ask on the process of verifying the identity:

- Who is asking for help? What do we know about him/her?
- What are the account details?
- What were the last actions performed on the account?
- What happened with the account?
- Why do they need their account back?
- How were we introduced to this case?
- Is there a third party that can endorse the account recovery necessity?
- Does the client have a secure email address to follow up on it?

2. How to use the providers automated reports:

For Facebook :
Before escalating the issue to the Facebook team, it is essential to make sure that the client already submitted his issue through the standard link in the first place. It is dedicated to hacked Account pages :

For a Facebook account: https://securityinabox.org/facebook_basic#2.2

For a Gmail account: enable two step verification and change the password to a new, stronger and more secure one.

[CASE OUTSIDE MANDATE]

Sometimes the request of the client is outside of our mandate. This could happen when it doesn't respect our mandate check-list(one of 12 requirements): https://procedures.cr.accessnow.org/access-ds-helpline-operators-manual/operators_manual.html#mandate-checklist

First, we need to get an approval from Jamie or Daniel if indeed the case is outside mandate.

Then, we need to draft a reply to the client that needs an approval from our supervisor.

Some potential answers we could provide are:

1. Generic advice on how to secure the client's account:

<!-- ##expand it would appear we only wrote FB? Why? -->

2. If the account was suspended because of the published content, we need to explain to the client that there are policies against such practices. We could provide some resources:
