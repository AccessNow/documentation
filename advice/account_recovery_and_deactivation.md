    Article #75: [SC] ChatSecure
    Article #141: [SC] Recommendations for Secure Chat Tools for Android and iOS

75 and 141 have different suggestions for chat encryption on Android. 141 is SoT due to having more detailed information, however it is worded as solving a couple specific requirements (use between iOS and Android etc.). I think we would need to change the wording used if we were to incorporate 75. Perhaps we should also compare 75's ChatSecure with the solutions offered in 141 and make a decision about what to recommend ultimately.

Email template "Article #124: [SC] - ChatSecure" is paired with 75. If we absorb 75 into 141, we should be aware of this.


CloudFlare - Email

    Article #89: How to add MX record/s for a specific domain in CloudFlare?
    Article #167: Issues with email after CloudFlare set-up

These two speak about email problems clients have after setting up CloudFlare. I think they are similar enough to be duplicates. 89 is the SoT, but 167 has information 89 needs.

CloudFlare - For Client

    Article #33: [WPS] - How to setup CloudFlare for a client?
    Article #72: DDoS CloudFlare Process

Probable duplicates, but 72 references email templates articles 27, 28 & 29 which 33 should, and does not. 33 is SoT.


Digital Security Outreach Templates: Spanish/English

    email template: Article #142: Degital Security Clinic Outreach template
    email template: Article #152: [IP] - Outreach Template - Spanish

I would like to combine the above templates as technically they are duplicates (152 is a very direct translation of 142 into Spanish), and the helpline could choose the most appropriate language from a single template easier than finding a separate article.


Suspicious Email

    Article #91: FAQ - [NDHS] - Handling phishing Incident - #91
    Article #58: [NDH] - FAQ - What to do if a client receives a suspicious email? - 58

Both articles describe what to do in the event of a phishing email, but 91's instructions are different than 58's. 58 is SoT by virtue of having other information. 91 should be absorbed into 58, adding its instructions.

Tunnelblick

    email template: Article 50: [IM] - Template: Tunnel blick instructions for Mac OS X - #50
    Article 145: Fix the issue of Traffic routing through our VPN on mac

This one is a strange one, so I would like input. 145 reads "class: the client wants to only route traffic to our internal network through vpn" and "Symptom: The client need VPN only to get access to our internal network" (emphasis is mine). Do we ever allow clients to access our internal networks? Do we refer to Access employees as the client? If this is about internal Access clients, these are duplicates, and 50 would be SoT. If we are referring to Access employees and helpline clients, these are not duplicates. 

The other thing is, 50 is an email template and has no guide or article repeating the information. As a template, it is not a duplicate of 145 because 145 is not an email template. However, this would then beg the question of whether or not they are paired together, as many email templates are to a "parent" article, which brings me back to my original question of wondering if Access employees get called clients too.


2 Step Focused:

    Article 90: [WPS] Two Steps verification fo gmail account.
    Article 95: Securing social media accounts.
    Article 168: Secure Yahoo account with 2 step verification

These three article may be consolidated, and I recommend placing them in #95, as that's the most general title (95 notes that 90 is similar, and suggests adding it under "Comments"). 168 fully walks through the 2 step process for Yahoo, but 90 & 95 provide no steps of how to secure gmail (90) or twitter/facebook (95). I would want to add steps to 90 and 95.

This is an email template with the same information as what 95 suggests:

    email template Article 94: [WPS] Secure social media: Twitter and Facebook accounts

However, 94 does include the steps to set up 2 step in Twitter and Facebook. I think 94 is the SoT for Facebook & Twitter. The email template steps should be added to an article, and perhaps more email templates should be created to cover other types of accounts.


Note:
Article email templates #11 & #15 regarding abuse of Tor Exit nodes sound similar, but according to Article #42, 11 is for high risk cases, 15 is for low risk, so no de-duplication is proposed. This is similar to Malware vs Adware in articles #133 & #134. Depending on how we decide to present articles in the future, some consolidation may be necessary.
