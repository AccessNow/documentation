## Securing Social Media and Online Accounts

Securing social media accounts is crucial for many human rights activists to post their ideas, communicate with their partners, and broadcast news. Their subject matter and popularity make them targets for hacking. 

Two-step verification can help to protect these vulnerable accounts, along with a comfort and awareness of the security settings. If available, it is also important to keep track of all devices that have logged in to an account. 

#### Symptom    
- Worries about the hacking vulnerability of a social media or online account primarily:
   * Google
   * Twitter
   * Facebook

- Recovery link sent to the client without their asking it

- Evidence that the account is being used without the owner's knowledge

- Concerns about account access attempts from devices not owned by the account holder

#### Problem    
- Securing the account and making sure that only the account owner has access to it

#### Solution:  
- Add layers of security for greater protection
   * Help the client to set up two-step verification (also called two-factor authentication)
   * Provide recommendations for privacy and security settings 
   * Teach the use of strong passwords and password management
